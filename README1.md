## Create a simple simple portfolio/profile website using React

## host it on netlify
## emoji - emoji search Application - start


## Wire framing
- rough design of any website before coding
## Semantic HTML tag
- these are the tags which have a certain meaning associated.
- from a technical point of view they are just regular container tags 
- for example instead of using div tag everywher we can use a meaningful thing
 - header,nav,section,footer,aside,content etc


### attaching Image in a component.
 - The image should be in src directory,recommend is inside assets directory inside src
 - we can just import and use it directly
 - once imported we can it as src of the img tag


**Note: when images,give alt attribute and make it meaningful dont include the term such as picture,image etc otherwise react will throw warning and empty string**

## variable is CSS:
- This is part of vanilla css
- the purpose is that we define once and use it everywhere multiple times
